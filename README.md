This is a personal repo, it will contain some personal configs of tile window managers that i like, i3 and hyprland.
Advice: I don't recommend to build hyprland + waybar on ubuntu, it's a hell of a nightmare.
I'f you're interested on any of those bleeding edge experience, i would tell you to try NixOS, Arch Linux or Fedora.
There are some flavour's of arch linux with tile window manager out of the box, like archcraft, endeavourOS, manjaro, etc.
I've personally used archcraft with BSPWM, would recommend if it's your first experience with tile managers.

Good lucky to build those on Ubuntu, kkk T.T

I'm using ubuntu right now with Hyprland.
My hardware:
i3 4005U;
8Gb Ram;
220SSD;

I've think i's faster than i3 and xorg environments in general.

Gnome builtin sucks by the way -> (incredibly slow on this hardware).
On the other hand, it took me 4 days to discover and compile the right applications to create a "reasonable desktop environment". That's because i've already used hypr before.

Arch and aur packages are so life changing.
Didn't try NixOs yet, but it seens "different".

On i3, there are two config folders, one more simple to use with 1 monitor and other to use with 2 monitors.
OBS: if youre using ubuntu, build i3 from source, dont use ubuntu repositories.
